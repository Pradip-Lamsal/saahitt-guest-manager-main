```

### 2. CAPTCHA Protection

- Protects against automated attacks
- Localhost bypass for development
- Proper error handling and retry mechanisms

### 3. Email Verification

- Prevents fake account creation
- Ensures valid email addresses
- Secure token-based verification

### 4. Multi-Factor Authentication

- Optional TOTP setup for enhanced security
- QR code and manual setup options
- Status tracking to prevent repeated prompts

### 5. Payment Security

- Enhanced payment form validation
- Removed security-problematic auto-refresh loops
- Method-specific payment collection

## Testing Recommendations

### Development Testing:

1. Test localhost CAPTCHA bypass functionality
2. Verify email verification flow with test emails
3. Test MFA setup with authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy)
4. Verify payment flow improvements

### Production Testing:

1. Test CAPTCHA functionality on `guestmanager.saahitt.com`
2. Verify email delivery and verification links
3. Test MFA setup and verification flow
4. Confirm payment flow improvements

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables:

- `VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY`: Cloudflare Turnstile site key (defaults to provided key)

### Supabase Configuration:

- Email verification enabled
- MFA support enabled
- Profiles table with `mfa_setup_completed` column

### Domain Configuration:

- Cloudflare Turnstile configured for `guestmanager.saahitt.com`
- Email verification redirect URLs configured

## Migration Required

Run the following to add MFA support:

```bash
npx supabase migration apply
```

This will add the `mfa_setup_completed` column to the profiles table.
